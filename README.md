Daily UI 008

So, after spending days in torture that is trying to pass tests in freeCodeCamp 
Frontend projects, doing Daily UI challenges came like a rain in the dry season.

I finished it relatively fast, and I even used position absolute for the first
time since I started doing UI challenges. Because of my habit of using things
that I am good at and that are easier to write, I did completely disregard 
positioning and now I just want to slap my old self!

Anyway, off to next project and see you there.
